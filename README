OnTap is an Android app that provides information about what's
available at a Barley Legal Homebrewers beer festival.

To build this software requires:
     The Android SDK with platform 1.6 (API 4)
These are required to run the Robolectric unit tests:
     Maven 2
     Maven Android SDK Deployer
     Maven Eclipse Plug-In (Required only if you use Eclipse)
     Robolectric

* Android SDK

 http://developer.android.com/tools/index.html

* Maven 3.0.5 or later

 http://http://maven.apache.org/

* Maven Android SDK Deployer

Available at https://github.com/mosabua/maven-android-sdk-deployer

Before using the Maven Android SDK Deployer, I recommend to install
*everything* from the Android SDK Manager.  I tried to install only
the SDK platforms I needed and the deployer complained it couldn't
find things I wasn't using.

* Maven Eclipse Plug-In 

In Eclipse, from the menu, select Help > Install New Software.  Set
"Work With" to "<Eclipse version name> -
http://download/eclipse.org/releases/<Eclipse version name>".  Set
filter text to "m2e".  Select "m2e - Maven Integration for Eclipse"
and "m2e - slf4j over logback logging (Optional)".  If you do not load
the latter, Eclipse will write this error to the screen when it
starts: 

SLF4J: Failed to load class "org.slf4j.impl.StaticLoggerBinder".  

This doesn't seem to have any other negative effects.

* Robolectric
